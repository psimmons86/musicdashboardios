# Change Log

## [Attempted Changes]

### 2025-03-05 14:00 PST - CloudKit Integration
- Added CloudKitService for persistent storage
- Added CloudKit entitlements and capabilities
- Result: ❌ Failed - CloudKit service not found in scope

### 2025-03-05 14:15 PST - MusicKit Service Approach
- Added MusicKit service capability
- Updated entitlements with musickit.service
- Result: ❌ Failed - Provisioning profile doesn't include MusicKit service entitlement

### 2025-03-05 14:17 PST - Module Structure Changes
- Added Package.swift
- Added module name and aliases to project.yml
- Result: ❌ Failed - Still having provisioning issues

### 2025-03-05 14:20 PST - Application Services Approach
- Switched to application-services instead of MusicKit
- Updated entitlements with application identifier
- Result: ❌ Failed - Still having provisioning issues

### 2025-03-05 14:21 PST - Minimal Configuration
- Removed all capabilities and entitlements
- Starting with basic app signing only
- Testing with empty entitlements file
- Result: Pending - Testing basic app signing before adding any capabilities

### Next Test (After Basic Signing Works):
1. Add CloudKit capability:
   ```xml
   <key>com.apple.developer.icloud-services</key>
   <array>
       <string>CloudKit</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. Add Music capability:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Access your music library</string>
   ```

## [Next Steps to Try]
1. Remove all custom capabilities and start with basic app setup
2. Add capabilities one at a time, testing each:
   - First: Basic app signing
   - Second: CloudKit services
   - Third: Media/Music access
3. Document exact error messages for each attempt

## [Known Working Configurations]
- None yet

## [Failed Approaches - Do Not Retry]
1. Using @_exported import CloudKitService
2. Using MusicKit service capability directly
3. Using application-services without proper team ID
