### 2025-03-05 14:31 PST - Fix CloudKit Configuration
- Set up proper CloudKit container identifier
- Configure CloudKit capabilities in project.yml
- Add iCloud services to required device capabilities
- Add specific CloudKit container identifier
- Result: Pending - Testing with proper CloudKit configuration

## [Current Configuration]
1. CloudKit Container: iCloud.com.musicdashboard.stats
2. Capabilities:
   - iCloud services
   - CloudKit
   - Background modes (audio, fetch)
3. Required Device Capabilities:
   - armv7
   - icloud-services

## [Next Steps]
1. Follow manual CloudKit setup process (see MANUAL_CLOUDKIT_SETUP.md)
2. Test CloudKit configuration
3. Add music usage description
4. Set up CloudKit schema for:
   - Track records
   - Listening sessions

## [Manual Setup Required]
Created MANUAL_CLOUDKIT_SETUP.md with step-by-step instructions for:
1. Apple Developer Portal configuration:
   - Enable iCloud capability
   - Select CloudKit service
   - Configure iCloud container
2. Xcode capability setup:
   - Add iCloud capability
   - Enable CloudKit service
   - Configure container
3. CloudKit Dashboard schema creation
4. Verification steps
5. Testing procedures

Important Note: In the Developer Portal, CloudKit is enabled by selecting "Include CloudKit support" radio button under the iCloud capability. After enabling CloudKit support, you'll need to:
1. Create an iCloud Container (if not exists)
2. Assign the container to your app ID
3. Configure the container in Xcode

The UI shows this as a simple radio button option, not as a separate service to configure as previously documented.

## [Known Working Configurations]
- None yet

## [Failed Approaches - Do Not Retry]
1. Using @_exported import CloudKitService
2. Using MusicKit service capability directly
3. Using application-services without proper team ID
4. Using MusicPlayer.shared instead of ApplicationMusicPlayer.shared
5. Using default CloudKit container instead of specific identifier
