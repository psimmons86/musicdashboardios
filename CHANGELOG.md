### 2025-03-05 14:20 PST - Application Services Approach
- Switched to application-services instead of MusicKit
- Updated entitlements with application identifier
- Result: ❌ Failed - Still having provisioning issues

### 2025-03-05 14:21 PST - Minimal Configuration
- Removed all capabilities and entitlements
- Starting with basic app signing only
- Testing with empty entitlements file
- Result: ❌ Failed - Compilation errors with MusicPlayer and CloudKit

### 2025-03-05 14:25 PST - Remove CloudKit Dependencies
- Use fully qualified MusicKit.MusicPlayer.shared
- Remove CloudKit imports and service usage
- Remove MusicDashboard module import
- Focus on getting basic music playback working first

### 2025-03-05 14:26 PST - Fix Music Player Usage
- Switch to ApplicationMusicPlayer.shared
- Update playback code to use correct class
- Keep focus on basic music functionality
- Result: Pending - Testing with correct music player class

### Next Test (After Basic Signing Works):
1. Add CloudKit capability:
   ```xml
   <key>com.apple.developer.icloud-services</key>
   <array>
       <string>CloudKit</string>
   </array>
   ```

2. Add Music capability:
   ```xml
   <key>NSAppleMusicUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Access your music library</string>
   ```

## [Next Steps to Try]
1. Remove all custom capabilities and start with basic app setup
2. Add capabilities one at a time, testing each:
   - First: Basic app signing
   - Second: CloudKit services
   - Third: Media/Music access
3. Document exact error messages for each attempt

## [Known Working Configurations]
- None yet

## [Failed Approaches - Do Not Retry]
1. Using @_exported import CloudKitService
2. Using MusicKit service capability directly
3. Using application-services without proper team ID
4. Using MusicPlayer.shared instead of ApplicationMusicPlayer.shared
